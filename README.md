  <p align="justify">
    Server Side Algorithms (SSA) is a platform with the objective to cover the gap between applications developers and scientists. Through a standard API described in our documentation (a link will be available soon), the registered developers are allowed to send HTTP requests to our server by requiring the execution of a specific algorithm on the provided data. These requests will be processed in real time and there is no limit to the number of requests a registered user can make. 
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
    In this way, developers with no scientific background have the opportunity to incorporate in their own applications complex algorithms and procedures, which have been developed by the experts of the sector and reviewed by our representatives.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
    On the other hand, scientists with a solid background in algorithms, high-performance computing, combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and many other fields, can upload on the platform their implementations. In this way, they will gain visibility and will have the opportunity to earn from the platform safely and without any need to incorporate their algorithms in an application or spend time in the development of a user interface.

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)


### Why Server Side Algorithms


Server Side Algorithms (SSA) is a self-maintained project. The initial service will be very basic, but we have intention to provide a more accurate documentation, and a more and more powerful server as the number of users increase. 
  
You can find our documentation at the following link: (soon available).

## Usage

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* FastAPI
  ```sh
  pip install fastapi
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mattianeroni/server-side-algorithms-doc.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
